    "   The following investigation explores a contemporary music dataset, aiming to answer the overarching question of \"What factors make music popular?\" This ultimate question can be broken up in to smaller inquiries such as \"What generes of music are most popular?\" and \"What are the most popular song keys and modes?\" among others. The answers to these questions can reveal what elements of music listeners are attracted to in the modern age. "
